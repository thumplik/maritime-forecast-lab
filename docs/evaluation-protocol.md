# Evaluation protocol

Normative source: build plan §6. This file records the concrete, implemented choices and is updated as the evaluator is built (Milestone 2).

## Replay (§6.1)

1. Sampler picks `(vessel_id, as_of)` at a real observation time.
2. Context = that vessel's observations with `observed_at <= as_of` (and nothing else unless the protocol permits it).
3. Target grid = `as_of + k·step` for k = 1..H.
4. Truth at each target time = linear interpolation between the two real observations that bracket it, **only if** both are within the truth region, belong to the same segment, and the bracketing gap ≤ the gap threshold (30 min). Otherwise `not_evaluable` with a reason.
5. Store per-sample, per-horizon records; never drop a failure.

`not_evaluable` reasons: `no_truth_after_cutoff`, `truth_gap`, `left_truth_region`, `segment_ended`, `insufficient_history`, `model_failed`.

## Protocols (§6.2)

| Id | Split | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P-paper | Reconstruction of arXiv 2609.25827 Houston split (vessel-disjoint) | Milestone 0 — calibration only |
| P-known | Chronological; own earlier voyages allowed | Milestone 1 |
| P-unseen | Chronological + vessel-disjoint by MMSI hash | Milestone 1 |
| P-region | Geographic cut | Milestone 1 |

## Metrics (§6.5)

Geodesic displacement error (km, nmi) per horizon; ADE/FDE; along/cross-track; median, p90, mean with paired bootstrap 95% CI resampling vessels. Paired: identical (cutoff, horizon) set for every model in a comparison.

## Calibration (§6.6)

`make calibrate` → paper-compatible constant velocity on P-paper vs the published table, ±10% tolerance. Assumptions made in reconstructing P-paper are listed in [coverage-audit.md](coverage-audit.md#calibration).
